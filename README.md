# implicit

Package for fitting reaction diffusion PDE's for ecological data with binary outcomes. For now, I am using this package for space-time modeling of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer in Wisconsin from 2002-present in a high-prevalence subsection of the state. Use devtools::install_github("stephenberg/implicit",INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch")) for now since this seems to require x64.
