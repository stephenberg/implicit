# implicit

Package for fitting reaction diffusion PDE's for ecological data with binary outcomes. For now, I am using this package for space-time modeling of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer in Wisconsin from 2002-present in a high-prevalence subsection of the state. The example code in the Example_fit folder fits a diffusion model to Wisconsin CWD data, and makes plots of the resulting fitted diffusions.
